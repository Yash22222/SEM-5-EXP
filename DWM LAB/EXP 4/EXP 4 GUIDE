AIM - Using open source tools Implement Classifiers

THEORY - 

1. Data Loading: The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the sample dataset using Pandas. The dataset contains features (feature1, feature2, feature3) and a target variable (target).

2. Data Splitting: The dataset is split into two parts: the features (X) and the target variable (y). This separation is essential as the features are used to train the classifier, 
while the target variable contains the labels or classes that the classifier will predict.

3. Train-Test Split: The data is further divided into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn. 
This allows for model training on one subset (training set) and evaluation on another subset (testing set) to assess its performance.

4. Classifier Selection: In this example, a Random Forest Classifier is chosen as the machine learning algorithm. Random Forest is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

5. Model Training: The selected classifier is trained on the training data using the `fit` method. During training, the model learns to map the features to the corresponding target labels.

6. Prediction: After training, the model is used to make predictions on the testing data using the `predict` method. This step evaluates how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

7. Performance Evaluation: The code calculates and prints the accuracy of the classifier, which is a measure of the percentage of correctly predicted instances in the testing set. Additionally, 
a classification report is generated, providing more detailed metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

CONCLUSION -

In summary, the code successfully demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a machine learning classifier using a sample dataset. 
The classifier, a Random Forest, is trained on a portion of the data and evaluated on another portion to assess its accuracy and performance. 
This type of workflow is common in machine learning for tasks like classification and can be extended to real-world datasets for various applications, such as spam detection, image recognition, and more.
