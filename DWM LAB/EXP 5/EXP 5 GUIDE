AIM - Using open source tools Implement Association Mining Algorithms

Theory -

The Apriori algorithm is a bottom-up approach to association rule mining. It works by first identifying the frequent itemsets in the data. 
A frequent itemset is a set of items that occurs together in a certain number of transactions. Once the frequent itemsets have been identified, the Apriori algorithm generates association rules from them. 
An association rule is a statement of the form "if item A is purchased, then item B is also likely to be purchased."

The Apriori algorithm uses the following steps to generate association rules:

1} It starts with the frequent itemsets of size 1.
2} For each frequent itemset of size 1, it generates all possible candidate itemsets of size 2.
3} It scans the data to count the support of each candidate itemset.
4} It removes any candidate itemset that is not frequent.
5} It iterates steps 2-4 until no new frequent itemsets are generated.
6} Once the Apriori algorithm has finished generating association rules, it filters the rules based on their confidence. 
The confidence of an association rule is the percentage of transactions that contain the antecedent and consequent of the rule. The Apriori algorithm only keeps the rules that have a confidence above a certain threshold.


CONCLUSION - 

association rule mining is a technique that can be used to identify patterns and trends in transactional data. 
This information can then be used to make better business decisions, such as targeted promotions, product placements, and personalized recommendations.
