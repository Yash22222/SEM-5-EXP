# DFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores a tree or graph by expanding the most recently discovered node as far as possible before backtracking. 
# It can be implemented using a stack data structure.
# This algorithm works by first adding the start node to the stack. Then, it repeatedly pops the top node from the stack and adds it to the visited list. 
# If the node has unvisited adjacent nodes, they are added to the stack. This process continues until the stack is empty, meaning all nodes have been visited.
# DFS is a simple and efficient algorithm that can be used to solve a variety of search problems. 
# However, it can also be inefficient in graphs with a large number of paths to the goal node. Other search algorithms, such as breadth-first search, may be more efficient in these cases.
