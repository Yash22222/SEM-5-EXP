THEORY - 

[1] CSS3 Syntax - CSS3 syntax is based on the following rules:

1. CSS declarations are made up of a property name and a value, separated by a colon (:).
2. Property names are always case-insensitive.
3. Property values can be any of the following:
4. Keywords, such as red, bold, and center.
5. Numbers, such as 10px and 3em.
6. Functions, such as rgb(), hsl(), and calc().
7. Strings, enclosed in single or double quotes.
8. Multiple declarations can be grouped together within curly braces ({}).
9. CSS declarations can be placed in either the <head> or <body> section of an HTML document.

[2] CSS3 Inclusion - CSS3 can be included in an HTML document in two ways:

1. Inline CSS: Inline CSS is applied to a single element and is placed directly within the <style> attribute of that element.
2. External CSS: External CSS is applied to multiple elements and is placed in a separate CSS file, which is then linked to in the <head> section of the HTML document.

[3] CSS3 Color - CSS3 colors can be specified in a variety of ways, including:

1. Hexadecimal: Hexadecimal colors are specified using a six-digit code, such as #ffffff for white and #000000 for black.
2. RGB: RGB colors are specified using three numbers, representing the red, green, and blue components of the color. For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is red and rgb(0, 0, 255) is blue.
3. HSL: HSL colors are specified using three numbers, representing the hue, saturation, and lightness of the color. For example, hsl(0, 100%, 50%) is red and hsl(120, 100%, 50%) is green.

[4] CSS3 Background - CSS3 backgrounds can be specified using a variety of properties, including:

background-color
background-image
background-repeat
background-position
background-attachment

[5] CSS3 Fonts - CSS3 fonts can be specified using a variety of properties, including:

font-family, font-style, font-size, font-weight, font-variant

[6] CSS3 Tables- CSS3 tables can be styled using a variety of properties, including:

border-collapse, caption-side, empty-cells, table-layout

[7] CSS3 Lists - CSS3 lists can be styled using a variety of properties, including:

list-style-type, list-style-position, list-style-image

[8] CSS3 Selectors - CSS3 selectors are used to select the elements that should be styled. There are a variety of selectors available, including:

1. Element selectors: Element selectors select all elements of a particular type. For example, the h1 selector will select all heading elements.
2. Class selectors: Class selectors select all elements with a particular CSS class. For example, the .my-class selector will select all elements with the class my-class.
3. ID selectors: ID selectors select all elements with a particular CSS ID. For example, the #my-id selector will select the element with the ID my-id.

[9] CSS3 Pseudo Classes - 
CSS3 pseudo classes are used to select elements based on their state. For example, the :hover pseudo class will select all elements when the user hovers over them.

[10] CSS3 Pseudo Elements -
CSS3 pseudo elements are used to select specific parts of an element. For example, the ::first-line pseudo element will select the first line of a paragraph.

CONCLUSION -

Here in this experiment we successfully implemented Css on last html file
