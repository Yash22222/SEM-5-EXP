AIM - React : Installation and Configuration. JSX, Components, Props, State, Forms, Events, Routers, Refs, Keys.

THEORY - 

[1] React Installation and Configuration - To install React, you can use the following command: 'npm install react react-dom --save' This will install React and React DOM to your project's node_modules directory.
    To configure React, you need to create a jsx transformer in your .babelrc file. This will allow you to use JSX syntax in your React components.

[2] JSX - JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript. This makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
    To use JSX, you need to import the React library. Then, you can use the < and > characters to define HTML elements.

[3] Components - React components are reusable pieces of code that can be used to build user interfaces. Components can be nested together to create complex layouts.
    To create a component, you use the function keyword followed by the component name.

[4] Props - Props are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed by the child component.
    To pass a prop to a component, you use the propName attribute.

[5] State - State is used to manage data that is specific to a component. State can be changed by the component itself.
    To use state, you need to declare a state variable in your component.

[6] Forms - React forms are used to collect data from users. To create a form, you use the <form> element.
    To handle form submissions, you use the onSubmit event handler.

[7] Events - React events are used to respond to user interactions. To listen for an event, you use the addEventListener() method.

[8] Routers - React routers are used to navigate between different pages in your application. To use a router, you need to install a third-party library, such as react-router-dom.
